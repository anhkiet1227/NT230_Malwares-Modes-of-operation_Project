# Malware Detection using Perturbation Method

This project explores the effectiveness of perturbation in generating evasive malware variants and evaluates the performance of a machine learning model trained on the original and perturbed datasets. 

## Dependencies

- Python 3.7 or higher (in this project is python 3.8.10)
- See requirements.txt for Python package dependencies

## Installation

1. Clone the repository: 

2. Install the required Python packages: `pip install -r requirements.txt`

## Usage

1. Run `notebooks/data_preparation.ipynb` to preprocess the malware dataset.
2. Run `notebooks/perturbation_method.ipynb` to generate perturbed samples of the malware dataset.
3. Run `notebooks/evaluation.ipynb` to train and evaluate a machine learning model on the original and perturbed datasets.
Note: For each step check the output of when finish running
